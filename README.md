# GGRS - P2P Rollback Networking in Rust
GGRS (good game rollback system) is a reimagination of the [GGPO network SDK](https://www.ggpo.net/) written in [Rust ðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It is currently very WIP and mainly a hobby project for myself. If you want to develop a rust application with rollback netcode, take a look at the awesome [backroll-rs](https://github.com/HouraiTeahouse/backroll-rs/), which both in a more usable state and maintained by more experienced people.
