In this article, I am going to briefly explain what it does and if you should consider using it.\nHow things were before\nIf you were using GGRS before 0.4.1, updating, loading and saving the game state would occur exactly as often as they would in GGPO. Loading is done once per rollback, but saving is done after every update step. This is how a rollback looks like in GGPO:\n[LOAD]\n[UPDATE]\n[SAVE]\n[UPDATE]\n[SAVE]\n[UPDATE]\n[SAVE]\n\nBy keeping a full history of gamestates, GGPO can always load the most recent and correct state. You could say that GGPO minimizes update steps.\nSaving and Loading Game State\nDepending on your application, saving and loading the game state can look wildly different, but one often used technique is serialization, for example with rusts popular Serde. In fact, GGRS's own examples use serde and bincode in order to save and load the gamestate. While very convenient, this usually results in computation time problems when saving multiple times in a single step, as in a rollback shown above.\nSparse Saving Mode\nAs a solution, GGRS offers a sparse saving mode for P2PSession. It is easily enabled before starting the session.\nsess.set_sparse_saving(true)?;\n\nThat's it. You don't need to change anything else in your code. When in sparse saving mode, GGRS minimizes save requests at the cost of additional update steps.\nThis works by only ever saving latest confirmed frame, for which we have received and confirmed input from all clients. This state is guaranteed to be correct and can be used as a loading point for every rollback. If no natural rollbacks occur (due to all predictions being correct or all inputs arriving on time), we sometimes might need to artificially induce a rollback in order to resimulate the last confirmed state and save it.\nWith sparse saving, GGRS guarantees to save at most once per update tick, at the cost of potentially longer rollback sequences. In the Rapier Synctest Example, an update step costs less than 0.5ms, while saving costs up to 3ms of time (due to the whole physics pipeline being serialized, which is definitely not optimal).

All Clients participating in the game create their own session and connect to each other in a peer-to-peer fashion.\nP2PSpectatorSession: Connects to another P2PSession in order to receive confirmed game inputs without contributing to the game input itself. If you want clients to spectate games, this is the session to use.\nSyncTestSession: Used mainly for debugging purposes, this session simulates a configurable amount of rollbacks each frame. This is a great way to test if your game updates deterministically. The SyncTestSession will compare checksums between original and resimulated gamestates and raise an error if something went wrong.\n\nSetup\nFor all sessions, you will have to define the number of active players contributing to the game input via num_players as well as the size of such inputs via input_size. The local_port is where your client will receive packets of remote clients.\nGGRS does not handle NAT hole punching. Check out this article for more information on the topic.\nP2PSession\nFirst, create a new session.\nlet local_port: u16 = 7000;\nlet num_players : u32 = 2;\nlet input_size : usize = std::mem::size_of::&lt;u32&gt;();\n\nlet mut sess = ggrs::start_p2p_session(num_players, input_size, local_port)?;\n\nThen, you should specify the players participating in the game, exactly as many as you defined through num_players. You can add exactly one PlayerType::Local, the rest should be PlayerType::Remote(addr).\nlet local_handle = 0;\nlet remote_handle = 1;\nlet remote_addr: SocketAddr = \"127.0.0.1:7001\".parse()?;\n\nsess.add_player(PlayerType::Local, local_handle)?;\nsess.add_player(PlayerType::Remote(remote_addr), remote_handle)?;\n\nOptionally, define any spectators you wish to add. The spectator_handle should be greater or equal to num_players. Internally, GGRS will add 1000 to the provided handle to identify the spectator client, so the resulting internal handle will be 1002 in this example.\nlet spectator_handle = 2;\nlet spec_addr: SocketAddr = \"127.0.0.1:7002\".parse()?;\nsess.add_player(PlayerType::Spectator(spec_addr), spectator_handle)?;\n\nYou can set input delay for the local player. You do not need to do this for remote players.\nlet desired_delay = 2;\nsess.set_frame_delay(desired_delay, local_handle)?;\n\nPer default, GGRS requests to save the gamestate after every update step in order to minimize rollbacks as much as possible. If saving your game state takes much longer than performing multiple update steps, GGRS has an alternative sparse saving mode where instead the amount of save requests are minimized at the cost of some additional state update requests.\nsess.set_sparse_saving(true)?;\n\nFinally, you can start the session. GGRS will then make an effort to establish communication between all clients. Only if the connection to all remotes (including spectators) has been established, the session will be able to advance the gamestate and send inputs.\nsess.start_session()?;\n\nP2PSpectatorSession\nFirst, create a new session. For the spectator, you will have to define a host_addr from which this session will receive inputs from all players. The defined host needs to add this client as a spectator, as well.\nlet local_port: u16 = 7002;\nlet num_players : u32 = 2;\nlet input_size : usize = std::mem::size_of::&lt;u32&gt;();\nlet host_addr: SocketAddr = \"127.0.0.1:7000\".parse()?;\n\nlet mut sess = ggrs::start_p2p_spectator_session(num_players, input_size, local_port, host_addr)?;\n\nOptionally, you can change the default catch-up parameters. Setting the catch-up speed to 1 will prevent any catch-up measures.\nsess.set_max_frames_behind(5)?; \nsess.set_catchup_speed(2)?;\n\nThen, you can start the session. GGRS will then make an effort to establish communication to the host. Only then will the session be able to advance the gamestate.\nsess.start_session()?;\n\nSyncTestSession\nFirst, create a new session. check_distance specifies how many frames of rollback you want to induce every frame. This value cannot exceed the maximum predicition frames allowed. Currently, 7 is the maximum distance of rollback that can occur.\nlet check_distance : u32 = 7;\nlet num_players : u32 = 2;\nlet input_size : usize = std::mem::size_of::&lt;u32&gt;();\n\nlet mut sess = ggrs::start_synctest_session(num_players, input_size, check_distance)?;\n\nAfterwards, you can optionally define input delays for any player you wish.\nlet input_delay = 2;\n\nsess.set_frame_delay(input_delay, 0)?;\nsess.set_frame_delay(input_delay, 1)?;\n\nYou don't need to define players or start the session. Because there are no remote clients to synchronize with, a SyncTestSession will immediately be ready to advance the game.\nMain Loop\nIn your main game loop, you should call advance_frame(...) in fixed intervals. How to do that exactly depends heavily on your software stack. You can also check out this article or this article to learn more about running your own gameloop.\nPlease see BoxGame P2P, BoxGame Spectator or BoxGame SyncTest for a full code example.\nHandling Requests\nIf calling advance_frame(...) succeeds, it will return a Vec&lt;GGRSRequest&gt;. Handling requests is mandatory. This sequence of requests is order-sensitive! You need to fulfill all requests in order. There are three types of requests:\n\nAdvanceFrame { inputs: Vec&lt;GameInput&gt; }: Advance the frame with the provided inputs\nLoadGameState { cell: GameStateCell }: Save the current gamestate by calling cell.save(your_state).\nSaveGameState { cell: GameStateCell, frame: Frame }: Load a previous gamestate by calling your_state = cell.load(). The provided frame defines frame from which this gamestate is at.\n\nPlease see BoxGame for a full code example.\nPolling Remote Clients\nIf you have spare time between rendering and updating your game, you can always call:\nsess.poll_remote_clients();\n\nThis will receive and handle incoming UDP packets and send queued packets to other remote clients. GGRS should work without explicitly calling this method, but frequent polling leads to timely communication between sessions.\nHandling Events\nEvents are notifications from the session for the user. Please see the examples or refer to the documentation what kind of GGRSEvent can occur.\n","id":"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/getting-started/quick-start/","title":"Quick Start"},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/help/":{"body":"","id":"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/help/","title":"Help"},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/help/faq/":{"body":"What is GGRS?\nGGRS (Good Game Rollback System) is a reimagination of the GGPO P2P rollback networking library written in 100% safe Rust.\nWhat is GGPO / Rollback?\nTaken from the official GGPO website:\n\nRollback networking is designed to be integrated into a fully deterministic peer-to-peer engine.  With full determinism, the game is guaranteed to play out the same way on all players computers if we simply feed them the same inputs.  One way to achieve this is to exchange inputs for all players over the network, only execution a frame of gameplay logic when all players have received all the inputs from their peers.  This often results in sluggish, unresponsive gameplay.  The longer it takes to get inputs over the network, the slower the game becomes.\n\n\nIn rollback networking, game logic is allowed to proceed with just the inputs from the local player.  If the remote inputs have not yet arrived when it's time to execute a frame, the networking code will predict what it expects the remote players to do based on previously seen inputs.  Since there's no waiting, the game feels just as responsive as it does offline.  When those inputs finally arrive over the network, they can be compared to the ones that were predicted earlier.  If they differ, the game can be re-simulated from the point of divergence to the current visible frame.\n\n\nDon't worry if that sounds like a headache.  GGPO was designed specifically to implement the rollback algorithms and low-level networking logic in a way that's easy to integrate into your existing game loop.  If you simply implement the functionality to save your game state, load it back up, and execute a frame of game state without rendering its outcome, GGPO can take care of the rest.\n\nFor more information about GGPO, check out the official website or the official github repository. A very good pseudocode explanation for general rollback networking can be found in this Gist.\nEven more questions?\nSend Georg Schuppe an E-mail:\n\ngeorg.schuppe@gmail.com\n\n","id":"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/help/faq/","title":"FAQ"},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/privacy-policy/":{"body":"TLDR: We do not use cookies and we do not collect any personal data.\nWebsite visitors\n\nNo personal information is collected.\nNo information is stored in the browser.\nNo information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties.\nNo information is shared with advertising companies.\nNo information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends.\nNo information is monetized.\n\nContact us\nContact us if you have any questions.\nEffective Date: 1st August 2021\n","id":"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/privacy-policy/","title":"Privacy Policy"}},"docInfo":{"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/authors/":{"body":3,"title":1},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/authors/georg-schuppe/":{"body":68,"title":2},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/blog/hello-world/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/blog/sparse-saving/":{"body":244,"title":4},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/contributing/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/":{"body":427,"title":2},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute/":{"body":117,"title":1},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/getting-started/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/getting-started/introduction/":{"body":25,"title":1},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/getting-started/quick-start/":{"body":538,"title":2},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/help/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/docs/help/faq/":{"body":193,"title":1},"https://gschup.github.io/ggrs/privacy-policy/":{"body":40,"title":2}},"length":16},"lang":"English"};
